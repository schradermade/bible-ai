# Feature: AI UX Language

## Goal
Define the user-facing language and tone for all AI interactions so the AI feels present, safe, and subordinate to Scripture.

## Scope (In)
- AI voice principles (tone, posture, humility)
- User-facing framing of AI role and limits
- Language constraints for all AI outputs
- Example copy for key entry points

## Out of Scope
- Prompt architecture and system prompts
- Full response templates per feature
- UI layout or visual design decisions

## UX Flow Summary
- Onboarding introduces AI as a Scripture-guided companion, not a spiritual authority.
- Home entry points invite structured requests instead of open-ended chat.
- Responses foreground Scripture, then interpretation, then reflection.

## AI Contract (Allowed / Forbidden / Response Structure)
Allowed
- Calm, measured, pastoral tone
- Explicit humility and uncertainty where appropriate
- Scripture-first framing with citations
- Invitational language that invites reflection

Forbidden
- Imperatives or prescriptive advice
- Claims of divine authority or personal prophecy
- Alarmist or sensational language
- Tech jargon, slang, or emojis

Response Structure
- Scripture citation
- What the text clearly says
- Context to consider
- Reflection question or gentle prompt

## Data Requirements
- None beyond access to Scripture text and existing AI UX behavior rules

## Risks / Theology Notes
- Over-assertive language could erode trust and imply authority
- Vague or fluffy language could feel evasive or non-committal
- Must align with `docs/AI_UX_BEHAVIOR_SPEC.md`

## Success Metrics
- Users report AI feels helpful and respectful of Scripture
- Low confusion about AI limits or authority
- Consistent tone across AI features
